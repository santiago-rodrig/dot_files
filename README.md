# Vim+Tmux

Easy configuration and plugins installation for vim, also there is a
configuration file for tmux, everything that you need to work comfortably
without needing to clone by hand every plugin repository again.

## Warning

You'll need vim 8+.

## Files

- .vimrc -> configuration for vim
- .tmux.conf -> configuration for tmux
- .tmuxline.conf -> status line description for tmuxline vim plugin

There is a **script for installation named `install.sh`** that places these files
where they should be, pretty straightforward, avoid the work of placing them
yourself.
