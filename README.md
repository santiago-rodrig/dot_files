# Config files

- **tmux**: `tmux.conf` contains keybindings for splitting panes and copy-pasting the vim way.
- **vim**: `vimrc` holds feature activations like numbers, no swap files, color column, syntax enabling, etc. All without plugins.

There is a script for installation named `install.sh` that place these files where they should be, pretty straightforward, avoid the work of place them yourself.
