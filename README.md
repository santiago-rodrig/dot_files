# vim-setup

Easy configuration and plugins installation for vim, everything that you need to work comfortably
without needing to clone by hand every plugin repository again.

## Requirements

## Configuration files

- .vimrc -> configuration for vim

There is a **script for installation named `install.sh`** that places these files
where they should be, pretty straightforward, avoid the work of placing them
yourself.
