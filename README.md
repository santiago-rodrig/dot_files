# Config files

- **i3wm**: no file yet
- **tmux**: `.tmux.conf`, place it at `$HOME`
- **vim**: `.vimrc`, place it at `$HOME`
- **zsh**: just install [Oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and then replace the `.zshrc` at `$HOME` with the one provided in this repo

There is an install script `install.sh` that installs all vim plugins that I
use.
